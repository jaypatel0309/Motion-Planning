## Overview

In this project, standard search algorithms **PRM**, **RRT** and **RRT*** are implemented. For **PRM**, 4 different sampling methods - **uniform sampling**, **random sampling**, **gaussian sampling** and **bridge sampling** are compared.

Files included:

**PRM.py** is the file containing PRM class with four different sampling methods.

**RRT.py** is the file containing RRT class for RRT and RRT*.

**main.py** is the script that provides helper functions that load the map from an image and call the classes and functions from **PRM.py** and **RRT.py**.

**WPI_map.jpg** is a binary WPI map image with school buildings. 

To Run:

The **main.py** loads the map image **WPI_map.jpg** and calls classes and functions to run planning tasks.
