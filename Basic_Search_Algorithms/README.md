## Overview

In this project, Basic search algorithms **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra** and **A*** algorithms are implemented. These are the basic algorithms for discrete planning, which also share a lot of similarities.

Files included:

- **search.py** is the file with algorithms.
- **main.py** is the script that provides helper functions that load the map from csv files and visualize the map and path.
- **map.csv** is the map file you could modify to create your own map.
- **test_map.csv** restores a test map for doc test purpose only. Do not modify this file.

## Get Started

When running **search.py** as a main function, it will run a doc test for all the algorithms. It loads **test_map.csv** as the map for testing.

For visualization, please run:

`python main.py`

There should be 4 maps shown representing the results of 4 algorithms. The **main.py** loads the map file **map.csv**.
